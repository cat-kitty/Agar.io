The goal of the game is to eat smaller circles, 
and to avoid being eaten by larger circles. You can 
move your circle using the mouse. You can also 
split your circle into halves by pressing the 
spacebar. You may not split again while your circle 
is still split. To rejoin your circles, press
shift+spacebar. Once your score reaches 250, 
you win the game. However, if any of the enemies 
reach a score of 250, you lose. Enjoy!
